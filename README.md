# RGB Color Game

This project was inspired by Colt Steele's Color Game project, many examples of which can be seen with a simple Google Search.
I decided to create a similar project using React.


#### What's being used? 
- React for managing the presentation logic of the application.
- CSS for designs


## Getting Started
In the project directory, run:

```
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
