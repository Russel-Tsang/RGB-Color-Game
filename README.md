# RGB Color Game

This project was inspired by Colt Steele's Color Game project, many examples of which can be seen with a simple Google Search.
I decided to create a similar project using React.

##### What's being used 
React for managing the presentation logic of the application.
CSS for designs

## Getting Started
In the project directory, run:

```
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
